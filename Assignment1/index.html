<h1>World of Warcraft</h1>


<h2>Blizzard Entertainment</h2>


<p>I love World of Warcraft because of it's deep and rich lore from the books and the games. World of Warcraft's game genre is classified as an MMO or also known as Massive Multiplayer Online game.
    Aaide from the deep lore the game has I enjoy the idea of being able to interact with others online in a shared space.
</p>


<h3>My Favorite Area</h3>


<p>My favorite area in the game is Teldrassil. Teldrassil is a giant tree where a race called Night Elves live and worship a moon goddess.
    The zone is visually appealing and fits the idea of overgrowth nature. The Night Elves are attuned with nature and have classes that allow them to turn
    into animals, they are called druids.
</p>


<h4>My Favorite Class</h4>


<p>In World of Warcraft you can select from 13 classes. The classes are Death Knight, Demon hunter, Druid, Evoker
    Hunter, Mage, Monk, Paladin, Priest, Rogue, Shaman, Warlock, Warrior. I personally enjoy playing the hunter class
    as it allows me to play with a pet and I enjoy attacking from a far range.
